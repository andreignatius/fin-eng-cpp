## Overview
This project involves defining and pricing various financial instruments such as options and swaps using C++. The project takes in "market data" in .txt or .csv or .json format to perform these operations.

## Features
- CSV Data Parsing: Efficiently reads and processes input data from CSV files.
- Financial Instrument Definitions: Includes classes and structures for different financial instruments.
- Options (e.g., Call, Put)
- Swaps
- Pricing Models: Implements pricing models for the financial instruments.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling for data processing and pricing calculations.
